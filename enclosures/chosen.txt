$2.11 in singles, pcb just under 100x100, so space, but also cheap still

98.7 absolute internal, set pcb to 98 width
85.4 set pcb high to 85


It's lovely, but it's only on TME.


Other options:
Hammond 1598 (actually a little too big)

Bud Industries:
bud HP-3652-B is ... good price, good size, but 90Â° off, usb ports go in the edge with the cutouts... not ideal (possibly too thin as well!)
HP-3664-B could work too, bit tight?
bud cu-794 would be a bit tight but nice price
CU-388 works! (have requested a step file)
CU-18428 is even more awesome! (may _not_ be, as the snaps may in places we want to put ports though...
