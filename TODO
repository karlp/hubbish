* missing ground connection to both caps for the 3v3 supply.  well done.
  will need bodge wire.
* horrible bom optimization...


* opening up on my other computer is still totally fucking busted
* the diode I picked for the "small" for the leds doesn't match the part I orderd, 323 vs 123 shits
* include a latest generation pick and place thingy?
